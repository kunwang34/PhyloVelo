# PhyloVelo - Phylogeny-based transcriptomic velocity of single cells

PhyloVelo is a computational framework to quantify the transcriptomic velocity field from phylogeny-resolved scRNA-seq data. PhyloVelo utilizes monotonically expressed genes (MEGs) along cell divisions as a transcriptomic clock to reconstruct the velocity vector fields of cell-state transitions, which enables robust and systematic cell-fate mapping in diverse biological contexts.
